# Documentation ooEGO - Launch 28, February 2025
The first USB with machine learning for smartphones, a simple and 
easy way to create, use and innovate artificial intelligence models.

● USB Ego One Edge MOPS* ML accelerator
- 480 MOPS* total peak performance
- 480 MOPS* using 0.26 watt
  
● USB Support 1.1 and 2.0 / TypeA socket and Type C with adapter

● Supports Linux, Mac, Windows and Android on host CPU

● Supports AppInventor serial extension with direct connection to your smartphone

 * MOPS = Million Operations Per Second

The Ego One USB Machine Learning (ML) with Accelerator Cryptographic adds an Edge MPOS* Microprocessor to yoursmartphone Android. It includes a USB-A socket and you can
connect to a host computer or smartphone Android with miniadapter to perform accelerated ML inferencing.

The on-board Ego One the case and the software technological extensions (Sciblock) that will be used together with the device were designed by OpenQbit that accelerates basic operations models ML in a power efficient manner: it's capable of performing 480 Million operations per second ( 480 MOPS* ), using 0.26 watts of power take care of the world. For example, one Ego One Edge MPOS* can execute state-of-the-art regression, classification, operations matrix and neural networks basic models and Ego One can execute models basic that the users create. This on-device ML processing reduces latency, increases data privacy, and removes the need for a constant internet connection.
